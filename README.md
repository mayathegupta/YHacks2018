## Project
"FLEET" is a vehicle management system designed to help car rental companies track use of their fleet of vehicles. This example is built specifically for airports that offer 
luxury, economy, or van rentals. It uses the smartcar API, WIX platform, and Twilio API
1. Users can see the location of vehicles on a map
2. Users can lock the cars from the dashboard after hours
3.
4.
// TODO
5. Users can select to opt into this feature. Google Locations will provide recommendations of major landmarks/tourist attractions while driving around. This will be sent to the users through Android/Apple car play OR through Twilio it will send a message. Waze integration?
6. Users that are visiting on business care about 1) Efficiency 2) Reliability. This should open up Waze on the dashboard of the car? OR it can use Twitter API and Twilio to send info to Android/Apple car play to read out alerts about the area to the driver.
7. Track the speed of users that are driving. IF their speed is over certain threshold ex) >30mph over speed limit, they may get a "bad" review from the car company since they may be more of a safety liability
